# Compatiblocks
Openplanet plugin that shows compatible next items/blocks to speed up placement in the editor

## Notes
- You will need to place the clipdata.json file in C:\Users\Username\OpenplanetNext\PluginStorage\Compatiblocks
- Right now this is in early dev still and isn't polished/performant/stable/clear yet. Sorry in advance for any issues or confusion!
- `old code (ignore).as` is there just for the few parts that show how to get block clip info. Delete it once block clips are supported.

## Todo
- Make it more clear what the keybinds are
- Make keybinds customizable
- Figure out a better way to handle clipdata.json
- See if we can crowdsource clipdata.json updates from users
- Get it working with block clips (trackmania already stores info about the clips for blocks, but it's a bit complicated)
- Add filters in the UI for things like:
	- Checkpoints/Start/Finish
	- Desired exit direction
	- Desired exit slope
	- Desired exit height (difference)
	- Desired exit road shape
